          Web consists of billions of clients and server connected through wires
          and wireless networks. The web clients make requests to web server.
          The web server receives the request, finds the resources and return
          the response to the client. When a server answers a request, it
          usually sends some type of content to the client. The client uses web
          browser to send request to the server. The server often sends response
          to the browser with a set of instructions written in HTML(HyperText
          Markup Language). All browsers know how to display HTML page to the
          client.

          HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the set of markup symbols or codes
          inserted into a file intended for display on the Internet. The markup
          tells web browsers how to display a web page's words and images. Each
          individual piece markup code (which would fall between "<" and ">"
          characters) is referred to as an element, though many people also
          refer to it as a tag. Some elements come in pairs that indicate when
          some display effect is to begin and when it is to end.

          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a simple mechanism for adding style (e.g., fonts, colors, spacing) to Web documents.

          These pages contain information on how to learn and use CSS and on available software. They also contain news from the CSS working group.    </p>

          JavaScript  was  designed  with  a  purpose  to  make  web  pages  dynamicand  more  interactive.  JavaScript  is  one  of  the  popular  scriptinglanguages  having  following  features:(a)It  can  be  used  for  client  and  server  applications.(b)It is platform independent which means it can run on any operatingsystems  (i.e.  Linux,  Microsoft  Windows,  Mac  OS  X  etc.).(c)JavaScript  codes  are  needed  to  be  embedded  or  referenced  intoHTML  documents  then  only  it  can  run  on  a  web  browser.(d)It  is  an  interpreted  language.(e) It  is  a  case-sensitive  language  and  its  keywords  are  in  lowercase  only.   </p>

          Relational database design (RDD) models information and data into a set of tables with rows and columns. Each row of a relation/table represents a record, and each column represents an attribute of data. The Structured Query Language (SQL) is used to manipulate relational databases. The design of a relational database is composed of four stages, where the data are modeled into a set of related tables.  </p>

          Server-side scripting as it relates to web pages usually refers to PHP code that is executed on the web server before the data is passed to the user's browser. In the case of PHP, all PHP code is executed server-side and no PHP code ever reaches the user. After the PHP code is executed, the information it outputs is embedded in the HTML, which is sent to the viewer's web browser.     </p>

          A web application is an interactive program that runs on a web server and is accessed through a web browser. A web app is built so that the user interface provides data back to the development team that designed it. This data offers insights into customer interests, usage, and preferences that can prove invaluable to product and marketing strategies. The data can also inform optimization and other client-centered aspects of the mobile app or desktop applications.

          A big difference between web applications and webpages is that user experience dictates web application design. Traditional web design is based on server-side programmers making decisions about what might enhance usability. In contrast, a web application has an application program interface (API) that takes in large-scale data from the user side and then funnels that information into automation.

          You can debug your JavaScript using the console JavaScript APIs and view the output messages in Logcat. If you're familiar with debugging web pages with Firebug or Web Inspector, then you're probably familiar with using console (such as console.log()). Android's WebKit framework supports most of the same APIs, so you can receive logs from your web page when debugging in your WebView. This topic describes how to use the console APIs for debugging.
